                  Daylens starts working without setup because the point is to see what your day actually looked like, not to spend the first hour configuring categories. Download it, open it, and let it watch. By the end of the day you will have a timeline of named work blocks, session detail, and a clearer picture of where your attention went.

                <h2 className="text-headline lp-docs-section-title">The Timeline</h2>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  The timeline is the answer to a more useful question than Screen Time asks. Not which apps were open, but what you were actually doing. Daylens watches your apps and browser activity natively, detects when the work shifts, and turns the day into labeled blocks that read like real sessions.
                </p>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  A block like "Tax Filing and Email" or "Mixed Development and Research Work" is not something you typed in. It came from analyzing the evidence of the session itself, so the timeline feels closer to memory than to a raw activity log.
                </p>
                <div className="lp-docs-infobox">
                  <span className="lp-docs-infobox-label">Note:</span>
                  You can jump to any past day from the date picker and ask the same question again: what was I doing at 2pm last Tuesday? The full history stays stored locally on your device.
                </div>
              </section>

              {/* Session Detail */}

                <h2 className="text-headline lp-docs-section-title">Session Detail</h2>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  Click any block and the rough picture turns precise. This is where Daylens moves past "you spent time in this app" and shows what was really inside the session.
                </p>
                <ul className="lp-docs-bullets">
                  {[
                    "The sites and pages that were open, with time spent on each",
                    "Primary and supporting apps inside the session",
                    "Context switches detected while the work was unfolding",
                    "The AI-generated explanation of what the block was actually about",
                  ].map((item) => (
                    <li key={item}>
                      <span className="lp-docs-bullet-dot" />
                      {item}
                    </li>
                  ))}
                </ul>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  Context switches are counted every time the active tab or window changes. A high switch count usually means the work was fragmented, research-heavy, or both. That gap between effort and output is often sitting right there in the switch count.
                </p>
              </section>

              {/* Stats */}

                <h2 className="text-headline lp-docs-section-title">Stats and Focus Score</h2>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  The stats view compresses the day into the numbers that matter most: total active time, category allocation, switching behavior, and whether the day felt calmer or more fragmented than usual.
                </p>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  The <strong style={{ fontWeight: 500, color: "var(--lp-ink)" }}>focus score</strong> is based on your own switching behavior relative to your own history. It is not judging you against some external benchmark. It is measuring whether this day was more scattered or more settled than your normal.
                </p>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  The <strong style={{ fontWeight: 500, color: "var(--lp-ink)" }}>intelligence insight</strong> reads the actual shape of the day and surfaces one thing worth noticing. It is not a generic productivity tip generator. It is grounded in what Daylens saw happen.
                </p>
              </section>

              {/* AI Analysis */}

                <h2 className="text-headline lp-docs-section-title">AI Analysis</h2>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  The AI layer is not a separate mode you have to turn on. It runs on every completed block automatically, building the understanding that makes the timeline useful in the first place.
                </p>
                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  It distinguishes primary tools from supporting ones, spots when you were researching versus actively building, and names the session from the evidence instead of from a template. The goal is to make the product already understand the shape of your day before you ask anything.
                </p>
                <div className="lp-docs-infobox">
                  <span className="lp-docs-infobox-label">Note:</span>
                  The AI analysis requires an internet connection to run. The data sent is your session metadata (app names, site titles, durations) — not screenshots, keystrokes, or file contents.

                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  The Insights tab is where the tracked history becomes queryable. Ask questions in plain language across any day, week, or custom range without having to reconstruct your context from scratch.

                <p className="lp-docs-body">
                  Answers are grounded in your actual activity data, and follow-up questions keep the thread alive. That is the broader direction of Daylens: help that starts with the picture already in view instead of making you relay it manually every time.
